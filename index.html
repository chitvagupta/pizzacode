    <h1>This page is about my true love: <span>Pizza!</span></h1>
    <p>I'm not even ashamed to say it - I absolutely <b>love</b> pizza. Whether it's cheesy slice at midnight or a loaded crust on a lazy Sunday, pizza never disappoints. This whole webpage is my little tribute to the one thing that never lets me down.</p>
    <p>My all time favorite? A classic Pepperoni with extra cheese and a garlic-stuffed crust. But honestly, I'll eat anything with melted cheese on a warm crust. üçï</p>
